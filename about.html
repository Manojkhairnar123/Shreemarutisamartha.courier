    <p>
      Our journey began on the streets of Nashik, going door-to-door, delivering parcels using borrowed vehicles and sheer determination. We didn’t have our own fleet, but we had something stronger—trust, hustle, and the Samartha spirit. From those humble beginnings, we’ve grown into a brand that stands for speed, care, and reliability. Today, Shree Maruti Samartha Courier isn’t just a service—it’s a promise. A promise to deliver every parcel with the same dedication we had when we carried them ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      We understand what it means to earn every customer, every delivery, and every smile. That’s why we’ve built a system that’s fast, personal, and future-ready—because we’ve lived every step of it.
